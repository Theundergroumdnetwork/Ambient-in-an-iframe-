# Ambient-in-an-iframe-
We use ambient proxy as our main one but we put the vercel link in a iframe once then in another iframe deployed to vercel to bypass all restrictions 
i would reckomend forking the real ambient proxy and then putting it in vercel then puting it though these for maximume security
